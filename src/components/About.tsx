            A passionate software developer (you&apos;ve heard that a million
            times, I know) from Nepal. I started my programming journey in late
            2021, with an old iPad, and a spark of interest. My first bit of
            code was a discord bot, that could respond with &quot;Pong&quot; â€”
            not impressive, but special (at least, to me)
            <br />
            <br />I went on to learn more about programming in general. How
            computers work? How to develop algorithms for certains task? How to
            think like a programmer? et cetera... With my love for programming
            and the countless free resources online, I became a well-skilled
            software developer by the end of 2022.
            <br />I later went on to learn APIs, a fair bit of Networking, and
            Linux{" "}
