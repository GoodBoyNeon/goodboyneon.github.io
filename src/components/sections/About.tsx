              A passionate software developer (you&apos;ve heard that a million
              times, I know) from Nepal. I started my programming journey in late
              2021, with an old iPad, and a spark of interest. My first bit of code
              was a <Highlight>Discord Bot</Highlight>, that could respond with
              &quot;Pong&quot; â€” not impressive, but special (at least, to me)
              <br />
              <br />I went on to learn more about programming in general. How
              computers work? How to develop algorithms for certains task? How to
              think like a programmer? et cetera... With my love for programming and
              the countless free resources online, I became a well-skilled software
              developer by the end of 2022.
              <br />I later went on to learn <Highlight>APIs</Highlight>, a fair bit
              of <Highlight>Networking</Highlight>, and most importantly,{' '}
              <Highlight>Linux</Highlight>{' '}
