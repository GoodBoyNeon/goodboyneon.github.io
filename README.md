## Credits

> This portfolio's design & layout was inspired by [Todor's Website](https://dvlpr.pro/) and [Brittany's Website (4th iteration)](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/). Note that "inspired" does NOT equal "copied", thus, no code was copied line-to-line from either of the websites. The only creditable portion are the layouts of various sections, and just the overall design (which includes the colors, gotten from Brittany's portfolio)

> Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Neon!
